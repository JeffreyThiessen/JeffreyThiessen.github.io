## About Me

I was born and raised in rural Manitoba, and found my love for Computer Science while going to Highschool in Steinbach MB. 

I am attending the University of Manitoba where I am currently in my final semester for my Undergraduate Honours in Computer Science.

My main fields of interest are Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, Brain Computer Interaction (and HCI in general), Computer Graphics, and Computer Networks. 

I also consider myself a pretty decent chef and try to test out as many new techniques and recipes as I can (ask me about my barley and farmers sausage soup).
