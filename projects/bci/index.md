# Filtering Muscular Interference from EEG Brain Data on Consumer Grade Devices using Neural Networks

A Computer Honours Project under supervision of Dr. Neil Bruce for the University of Manitoba.

### About This Project
The goal of this project is to determine the extent to which a computer or devices can be controlled via neural activation and EEG while controlling for activation associated with muscle control.

After working on trying to use the EEG data I showed last week, I ran into a few issues. Mainly that the data itself did not have the events in their own channel in the data and instead were attached to a separate text file. I lost more time than I would have liked to this and other issues (such as my home machine only has 8GB of ram which caused loading problems that took some time to fix). Between that and Midterm exams, progress was slow but I feel that I have learned a lot in the last weeks.

After talking with Dr. Bruce we felt that going forward we will want to start with a simpler approach. Specifically I will be using/creating an autoencoder on the data to encode the REM/NREM states and examining what we can see in the data from there.
