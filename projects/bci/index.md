# Filtering Muscular Interference from EEG Brain Data on Consumer Grade Device using Neural Networks

A Computer Honours Project under supervision of Dr. Neil Bruce for the University of Manitoba.

### About This Project
The goal of this project is to determine the extent to which a computer or devices can be controlled via neural activation and EEG while controlling for activation associated with muscle control.

### Latest Project Blog Update

#### January 28, 2017
In the last week I have been familiarizing myself with the pytorch machine learning environment as it looks to be a solid framework to use for this project. I have found a few different projects others have done on BCI and EEG data that might prove to be a great foundation for this project, but I'll need to look more closely at them before making any decisions. 

I have also been updating my knowledge on modern CNN and RNN algorithms, as the ammount of machine learning I knew before starting the project was not nearly enough to create and understand the workings of a recurrent neural network.

I found the following resources to be the most helpful in my learning so I figured I would link them here so you too can get a better understanding of neural networks.

[Mind: How to build a neural network](http://stevenmiller888.github.io/mind-how-to-build-a-neural-network/): A great introduction to neural networks.

[Video Lecture: Recurrent Neural Networks by Stanford University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6niqTuYFZLQ): An indepth look at recurrent neural networks and how they can be used.

[PyTorch tutorials overview](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/index.html): The basics of using PyTorch.

[PyTorch tutorial on RNN classification](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html): A more advanced tutorial on RNN and how they can be built.
